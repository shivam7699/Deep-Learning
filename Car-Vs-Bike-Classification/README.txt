Car vs Bike Classification ML Project
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying images as either cars or bikes. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately differentiate between car and bike images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled images of cars and bikes. The dataset is divided into two subsets: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Model
The model used for this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn relevant features from the input images. The model is trained using the training set and optimized using a suitable loss function and an appropriate optimization algorithm.
